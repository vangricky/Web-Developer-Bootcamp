        <!--So this is how you comment. This comment is for the things I have written below.
Below, we have <b> for bold, and <br> to continue the secntence on a new line.-->
<b>Chicken</b><br>They are really sweet, I think, haha. Well, for the most part.
Anyways, chicken are really yummy in my tummy.<br>
Also, my name is Ricky Vang. This is a test site.

<!--Below we have <p>. This is a paragraph tag. -->

 <p>
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
    the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
    including versions of Lorem Ipsum

<!--Below, we have <h1> all the way to <h6> headings. These are just headings. <h1> is bigger,
     than it goes from highest to lowest. <h6> will be a heading, but will be a bit smaller.-->
<h1>
    This is a heading and it will be shown as the heading. So it might be a bit bigger.
<h2>This can be anything.</h2>
<h2>This is another test because, why not, right?</h2>
<h3>Behavior</h3> 
<p>
    Then we can add a paragraph here, or wherever you feel like it underneath the h3 or whatever h you feel.
</p>
<h4>I am h4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5, here I am.</h5>
<h6>I am h6 here, haha. Okay, also, note! Do not have any h6 if you dont have and
    h5's. Same goes to any h's. Can't do an h3 if you don't have an h2. Blabla so on. Sweet!

<!-- Now, this bottom portion, we'll be making a LIST!!!!
<ul>: unordered list (bullet pointed list)
<ol>: ordered list (numbered list) -->
<h2>Breeds</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Silkie</li>
    <li>Polish</li>
    <li>Easter Egger</li>
    <li>Road Island red</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Silkie</li>
    <li>Polish</li>
    <li>Easter Egger</li>
    <li>Road Island red</li>
</ol>

<!-- To add another list in a list. Do the below-->

     <ul>
        <li>Bantom
            <ul>
                <li>Silkie</li>
                <li>Polish</li>
                <li>Easter Egger</li>
                <li>Road Island red</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
  </ul>

<!-- Now this is how you add links to your page.
These are called "Anchor Tags"
Remember to do "http://www."-->
<a href="http://www.google.com">I AM A LINK!!!</a><br>
<a href="BOILERPLATE.html"> Boilerplate></a>
<p>Alright, so this is a test. But if you click the word
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">
        Spider-Man</a>, it will take you to the Wikipedia 
        Spiderman Page.</p>



<!-- Alright, so this is the image part of the course.
The first picture will be from a picture saved on your 
computer, in a folder. 
The second picture will be sourced from the internet.
(Copy image address)-->
<img src="Test Pic.jpg" width="300px">

<img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/02/france-in-pictures-beautiful-places-to-photograph-eiffel-tower.jpg" alt="Image of the Eiffel tower in france">

<!--Next, we are going to be talking about Divs.
Div is basically making a box, or grouping, content together.
We will be doing <span> as well. In future practices down below.-->

<div>
<img src="Test Pic.jpg" width="300px">
<br>
<img src="https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2020/02/france-in-pictures-beautiful-places-to-photograph-eiffel-tower.jpg" alt="Image of the Eiffel tower in france">
<p>These two pictures, and this text, will now be "grouped"
    together. With CSS, we can see the difference.
</p>
</div>
<!--Elements to learn, remember, and use for fun, or foreals
<hr> : it just makes a line across the page.
<br> : it skips down to the next line and not go forever. 
    VERY useful for poems.
<sup> : it is an exponent for example. it basically
    is when the text is right above the number/alphabet.
    another example are "footnotes", the tiny number above
    the word or something on the right side.
<sub> : creates text  below the baseline. opposite of 
    what <sup> is. number is on the bottom right of the word.

<!--HTML ENTITIES.It is special codes/sequences/symbols that
we can use in our HTML, that will result in different characters.
They all start with "&" and end with ";"  -->

<p>If you wanted to do this.
    1 < 2 
<br>
You will need to do 1 &#60; 2

<!--Semantic markup!
Semantic: relating to meaning
"what purpose or role does that HTML element have?"
So, we have:
    <main>
    <header>
    <footer>
    <section>
    <article>
    <aside>
    <summary>
    <details>
    <div>
    <time>
    <figure>

    So, all these are the same as <div>
    BUT! They just let us know what they are, thats it.
-->
<!-- PLAYING with antic elements.
<main>: it represents the dominant content of the <body> content.
    it basically goes right after the <body> in the html code
<nav>: this represents where you put links, or where links
    should totally go, lol.
    This also lets the reader that is reading your code
    understand where your navigation bar is, such as
    links, clickable links.
<section>: represents a standalone section in your <body>
<article>: represents a self contained compostion in a document.
    for example, if you want to have an article/blog/weather/reviews
    you can use <article> to divide and name it out c:
<aside>: if you have things you want to include on your page
    that is off topic or not about the page, you can use 
    <aside> to categorize this part of your html code.
<header>: you put <header> in the introduction, or the navigation bar at the top
<footer>: mostly at the bottom of the page. has links or whatever at the bottom.
